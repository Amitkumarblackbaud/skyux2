A beta version of SKY UX 2 built on Angular 2 is now available. To install SKY UX 2 components without any other SKY UX 2 features, use NPM version 3+. (We recommend NPM version 3+ for its flat dependency structure.)

`npm install @blackbaud/skyux`

For documentation on the SKY UX 2 components, see [the Components section of the SKY UX 2 website](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/components).

In addition to components, SKY UX 2 also includes SKY UX Builder to provide for a rapid development process with minimal setup for developers to create single-page applications. For guidance on how to install the command line interface for SKY UX Builder, see [the initial setup section of the SKY UX 2 website](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/learn/tutorials/inistall).
